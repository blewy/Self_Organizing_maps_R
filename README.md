# Self_Organizing_maps_R
A small tutorial on self organising maps in R.

I got some simple data and tried to use SOM on it.
The ideia is to improve my intuition about this method to be able to apply this technique.

Please disregard some issues with categorcial vs continuous variable, for the sake of fast develpment I considered all features/variables continuous.

Please see this web page for mode info:

Enjoy the coding and learning something new.
