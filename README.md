# Self_Organizing_maps_R
A small tutorial on self organising maps in R.

I got some simple data and tried to use SOM on it.
Thw ideia is to improve my intuition about this method to be able to apply this technique.

Please disregard some issues with categorcial vs continuous variable, for sake of fast develpment I considered all continuous.

Please see this web page for mode info:
